## Introduction
Modify test! Modify test! Modify test! Modify test! Modify test! Modify test! Modify test! Modify test! Modify test! 
This is a set of best practices
for Free/Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS) projects.
Projects that follow these best practices
will be able to voluntarily self-certify and show that they've
achieved a Core Infrastructure Initiative (CII) badge.
Projects can do this, at no cost,
by using a web application (BadgeApp)
to explain how they meet these practices and their detailed criteria.

There is no set of practices that can guarantee that software
will never have defects or vulnerabilities;
even formal methods can fail if the specifications or assumptions are wrong.
Nor is there any set of practices that can guarantee that a project will
sustain a healthy and well-functioning development community.
However, following best practices can help improve the results
of projects.
For example, some practices enable multi-person review before release,
which can both help find otherwise hard-to-find technical vulnerabilities
and help build trust and a desire for repeated interaction among developers
from different organizations.

These best practices have been created to:

1. encourage projects to follow best practices,
2. help new projects discover what those practices are, and
3. help users know which projects are following best practices
